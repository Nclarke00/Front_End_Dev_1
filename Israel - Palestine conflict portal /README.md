# Israel - Palestine conflict information page

The purpose of this project is to educate the public about the ongoing conflict between Israel 
and Palestine. My webpage does not persuade the user to take the side of either party. Additionally 
the page will only contain facts, statistics, and educational resources about the conflict, but will 
not contain opinioins of myself or any other individual or group. 

This toic is important to me because I have viewed some of the narritive about the issue to be 
harmful and heavily partisan. I have observed individuals giving opionians on the topic with 
little real knowledge of the subject and I see govenments and elected officails posing a wildly
one-sided view of the issue in an effort to push a greatly politicised agenda. in the midst 
of propoganda and uneducated yet stong opinions I find it important to educate individuals about 
the highly complex and nonbinary issue that is the conflict taking place in Israel. 

For this Project, I intend to use the API's of both 'israelpalestinetimeline.org' 
and the United nations human rights office to access their databases. I then 
intend to use javascript to create multiple visualizations to represent the data.
Lastly, I want to provide access to one crashcourse and one TedTalk that summarizes
the history of the conflict. There is also data on wikipedia about the conflict 
that spans earlier than the year 2000 that I beleive would be helpful. 
To make the page responsive, I will add this <meta> tag to my web pages
