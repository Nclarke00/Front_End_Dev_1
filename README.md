# Milestone 1

On the homepage of my class portal, I will display the last 3 assignments that have been posted. 

Beneath those 3 posts, there will be a chronological list of every assignment that I have 

completed for the class with a brief description next to it. If you click on one of these images,

you will be brough to a seperate page with an in-depth description of the assignment below a 

larger image of the submission in it's entirety. Personalizations include a countdown to graduation

for my grad program, and various polls related to my interests. For example, what are the best 

ski mountains, best climbing spots, who will win thursday night football, my top 10 list(s) of 

video games which you can upvote and downvote, and a suggestion section for the best bars in 

denver/boulder with the option to upvote and downvote. 



# milestone 2

For the most part, I used stack overflow for my html and css. I also Used peter's notes for 

help specifically with the buttons that link to other websites.

# Assignment 1: Javascript and the DOM

For assignment 1 I created a page that contain three different buttons. The first two buttons do nothing, however when you hover your mouse over the buttons, they will highlight red. The third button will go through a list of three different sentences. Additionally, you can use your right arrow key to move through the list. I found a lot of the basic skeleton from stack overflow. When Trouble shooting, I used chat gtp text to help me diagnose problems. I had a particularly difficult time figuring out the feature that changes the displayed sentance, so I had my roommate Amey, a cybersecurity student, help me get that part running effectively. 

# Assignment 2

For assignemt 2, I used stack overflow for some of the base code. I used it to learn about the "for" attribute in a <label> tag. I also used stack overflow to learn how to use the <select> element to create a dropdown menu. Using these peices of information, I was able to create a form where the user can input their name, date of birth and other personal information. 



# Assignment 3

to debug the code I modified the random number generator. I multiplied math.random by the number of elements in the array. I also changed questions.count to questions.length. There were also a number of syntax errors that I corrected like how there was no period before score-area and the lack of commas in the array. 

# Assignment 4

In this assignment I use fetch to get a list of random facts. upon pressing the button, the page will display a random fact from that list. When the button is pushed, I use the fetch() funciton which initiates a request to the api of useless facts.jsph. .then(response => response.json()) converts the data to json format. The text content is then set to text property of the data object. 

# Assignment 5
For this assignment I used parcel instead of webpack as a bundler. I creted a simple html file and followed a youtube video and the parcel website in order to figure out what commands to use in the terminal.
