# Milestone 1

On the homepage of my class portal, I will display the last 3 assignments that have been posted. 

Beneath those 3 posts, there will be a chronological list of every assignment that I have 

completed for the class with a brief description next to it. If you click on one of these images,

you will be brough to a seperate page with an in-depth description of the assignment below a 

larger image of the submission in it's entirety. Personalizations include a countdown to graduation

for my grad program, and various polls related to my interests. For example, what are the best 

ski mountains, best climbing spots, who will win thursday night football, my top 10 list(s) of 

video games which you can upvote and downvote, and a suggestion section for the best bars in 

denver/boulder with the option to upvote and downvote.
