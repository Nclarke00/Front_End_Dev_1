# Milestone 1

On the homepage of my class portal, I will display the last 3 assignments that have been posted. 

Beneath those 3 posts, there will be a chronological list of every assignment that I have 

completed for the class with a brief description next to it. If you click on one of these images,

you will be brough to a seperate page with an in-depth description of the assignment below a 

larger image of the submission in it's entirety. Personalizations include a countdown to graduation

for my grad program, and various polls related to my interests. For example, what are the best 

ski mountains, best climbing spots, who will win thursday night football, my top 10 list(s) of 

video games which you can upvote and downvote, and a suggestion section for the best bars in 

denver/boulder with the option to upvote and downvote. 



# milestone 2

For the most part, I used stack overflow for my html and css. I also Used peter's notes for 

help specifically with the buttons that link to other websites.

# Assignment 1: Javascript and the DOM

For assignment 1 I created a page that contain three different buttons. The first two buttons do nothing, however when you hover your mouse over the buttons, they will highlight red. The third button will go through a list of three different sentences. Additionally, you can use your right arrow key to move through the list. I found a lot of the basic skeleton from stack overflow. When Trouble shooting, I used chat gtp text to help me diagnose problems. I had a particularly difficult time figuring out the feature that changes the displayed sentance, so I had my roommate Amey, a cybersecurity student, help me get that part running effectively.
