# Assignment 3

to debug the code I modified the random number generator. I multiplied math.random by the number of elements in the array. I also changed questions.count to questions.length. There were also a number of syntax errors that I corrected like how there was no period before score-area and the lack of commas in the array. 

# Assignment 4

In this assignment I use fetch to get a list of random facts. upon pressing the button, the page will display a random fact from that list. When the button is pushed, I use the fetch() funciton which initiates a request to the api of useless facts.jsph. .then(response => response.json()) converts the data to json format. The text content is then set to text property of the data object. 

# Assignment 5

For this assignment I used parcel instead of webpack as a bundler. I creted a simple html file and followed a youtube video and the parcel website in order to figure out what commands to use in the terminal. 

# Project 2 Reflection

My goals for the project were primarily to find facts and information about the solar system to be displayed on the page, to create the quiz. I did acheive both of these goals but certainly not to the level that this project required of me. I failed to successfully use react in the project. I created the quiz and provided the information for it, although it was not up to the expected standard. One challenge was getting the entire group to work together. Although I worked with Waldo on several occasions both in and out of class, I never had the contact information of the other group member so it was difficult to coordinate. I was reminded by this project how imortant it is to make connections. In the future I will make sure to be more of a leader to ensure the group is well coordinated and accomplished the tasks set in front of us.
