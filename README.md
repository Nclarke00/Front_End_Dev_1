# Assignment 3

to debug the code I modified the random number generator. I multiplied math.random by the number of elements in the array. I also changed questions.count to questions.length. There were also a number of syntax errors that I corrected like how there was no period before score-area and the lack of commas in the array. 

# Assignment 4

In this assignment I use fetch to get a list of random facts. upon pressing the button, the page will display a random fact from that list. When the button is pushed, I use the fetch() funciton which initiates a request to the api of useless facts.jsph. .then(response => response.json()) converts the data to json format. The text content is then set to text property of the data object. 

# Assignment 5
For this assignment I used parcel instead of webpack as a bundler. I creted a simple html file and followed a youtube video and the parcel website in order to figure out what commands to use in the terminal.
